### What I learned

This may be something so basic, but idk why I struggle with the resets for CSS. I guess it's lack of practice, but for this project, this is the code that I used, maybe it could use an improvement, but for this time, this worked for me.

```css
body {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
    }
```
